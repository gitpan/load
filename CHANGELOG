0.17	9 July 2005
	Finished AutoLoader emulation mode and adapted testing accordingly.
	Fixed some test problems if ifdef.pm is not installed.  Changes tests
	so that the first failure will die with a dump so that specific
	problems can be worked on more precisely.

	Verified load.pm works on Perl 5.8.7.

	30 September 2004
	Added initial support AutoLoader emulation mode.

	Verified load.pm will work on Perl 5.8.5.

0.16	15 March 2004
	Changed tracing calls so that they get optimized away if tracing is
	not active.

	Fixed bug that would cause "ifdef.pm" to split on every character if
	"now" loading was selected.

	Fixed bug with subs that really do not exist.  Added some more test
	with regards to the interface with "ifdef.pm".

0.15	14 March 2004
	Added support for "ifdef.pm".  If ifdef.pm is loaded, then all eval's
	will be done using the source filter provided by ifdef, possibly
	activating code depending on environment variables being set.  Added
	tests to check functionality when ifdef.pm is loaded.

	Fixed some possible minor problems with localizing $_: it appears a
	simple "local $_" is not enough, instead a "local $_ = \my $foo" seems
	to be the canonical solution to this problem as of now according to
	p5p.

	28 January 2004
	Made sure the test-suite cleans up on multi-versioned systems.

0.14	28 December 2003
	Added automatic required modules update using Devel::Required.

0.13	12 November 2003
	Perl 5.8.2 does not handle empty subroutines (sub foo {}) very well.
	In some cases, it segfaults.  This happened in the test-suite.
	Test-suite has been adapted (that really is the only change, apart
	from the version number).

0.12	29 September 2003
	Added support for register additional "use" modules for specific
	packages (e.g. when subroutines need to be handled by a source
	filter).  Tests to be added later, if ever here.

	26 September 2003
	Realised testing for running under taint was pretty trivial: the
	entire test-suite now runs twice: once with and once without tainting.

0.11	26 September 2003
	Turns out load.pm didn't work when taint was active.  And it silently
	failed to boot.  This should now be fixed.  Added a todo to make tests
	that will functioning under taint: activating taint in the tests
	caused too many failures to allow checking in the allotted time..

0.10	18 September 2003
	Frank Tolstrup pointed out some test misses because of CRLF versus LF
	issues on Windows.  These should now also be fixed.  Mention Frank
	in the new ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS section of load.

	Added thread indicator to trace if threads are used.  This should
	facilitate debugging of the Thread::xxx modules.  Added tests for
	it as well.  For the trace to properly detect threads, the threads
	module must have been loaded prior to loading load.pm.

	17 September 2003
	Hmmm... I may be taking the "release soon, release often" too
	literally.  Anyway, Frank Tolstrup's output of the failing test-suite
	under Windows, pointed to a possible seek() problem under Windows.
	Added a binmode() in case the source-file is opened again for on-demand
	loading of a subroutine.  And the tests with $Foo::{} also failed
	under Windows: they shouldn't anymore.

	Installed experimental trace possibility that is activated by setting
	the environment variable "LOAD_TRACE" to a true value.  This is still
	experimental so therefore only documented here.

0.09	17 September 2003
	Frank Tolstrup pointed out that many of the tests wouldn't run under
	Windows because of quoting issues.  Adapted the test so that would
	not be an issue anymore.  Hope this is the last one of today ;-)

0.08	17 September 2003
	Indeed, it is one of those days.  Added some more tests to make sure
	that subroutines are indeed loaded on demand.

0.07	17 September 2003
	Argh.  I guess it is one of those days.  Using strict in load.pm
	bleeds into the eval's and causes compile errors.  And of course
	the test-suite didn't catch it.  Removed stricture but added a
	comment in the source about it.  Adapted the test-suite so it _will_
	catch it this time (but won't of course, because it's fixed).

0.06	17 September 2003
	Finally figured how to make something like a test-suite.  Now checks
	whether ondemand subs can be called and whether or not they exist
	and can be can()ned.

	Argh.  A typo caused the "now" functionality to completely broken.
	This is now fixed.  Problem was introduced in version 0.02.

	Added optional support for strict and warnings in the source.

	11 August 2003
	Fixed stupid typo in Makefile.PL that caused description of module
	not to be included ever.

	Verified load.pm will work on Perl 5.8.1.

0.05	29 December 2002
	Increased version to be able to upload a more recent version of load.pm
	to CPAN to prevent interference with Jos 'Kane' Boumans' version of
	load.pm.

0.04	21 October 2002
	Fixed small problem when running with warnings and attempting to access
	non-existing subroutine.  Spotted by Lars Fenneberg.

0.03	1 October 2002
	Changed using of lexical file handles to globs, to ensure compatibility
	with earlier versions of Perl.

	Fixed problem with running with warnings (caused by UNIVERSAL::can
	redefine).  Removed use strict and other stuff to make this module
	yet leaner and meaner.

0.02	30 September 2002
	Now hijacks UNIVERSAL::can so that ->can does the right thing for
	subroutines that have not been loaded yet.  As a side effect, this
	loads the subroutine specified.  Added documentation to reflect that.

	Localised $_, $! and $@ at several places just to make sure they
	don't clobber anything on the outside.

	Added support for line numbers and file name (swiped from AutoSplit
	generated code), so that eval errors will give you more information.

	Added check for DESTROY: apparently you get an infinite loop if you're
	gotoing the DESTROY if it doesn't exist.  Now AUTOLOAD just returns
	for DESTROY if it doesn't exist.

	Fixed typo in _scan() which would trigger a loop if a second __END__
	was encountered in the source of a module.

0.01	29 September 2002
	First version of load.pm, renamed from jit.pm after discussions on and
	off p5p.
