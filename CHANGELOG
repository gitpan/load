	Now hijacks UNIVERSAL::can so that ->can does the right thing for
	subroutines that have not been loaded yet.  As a side effect, this
	loads the subroutine specified.  Added documentation to reflect that.

	Localised $_, $! and $@ at several places just to make sure they
	don't clobber anything on the outside.

	Added support for line numbers and file name (swiped from AutoSplit
	generated code), so that eval errors will give you more information.

	Added check for DESTROY: apparently you get an infinite loop if you're
	gotoing the DESTROY if it doesn't exist.  Now AUTOLOAD just returns
	for DESTROY if it doesn't exist.

	Fixed typo in _scan() which would trigger a loop if a second __END__
	was encountered in the source of a module.

	First version of load.pm, renamed from jit.pm after discussions on and
	off p5p.
